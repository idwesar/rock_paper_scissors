# Rock, paper, scissors

A simple rock, paper, scissors game I made after a month or so of learning Python.
Computer_plays_itself was my proof of concept to learn how the game would work, and Interactive_rock_paper_scissors is the completed game which allows for user input.

## How to play (interactive only):
 - When prompted, type your choice of action (rock, paper, or scissors) into the command line
 - The computer will make its move, and the outcome will be revealed! The game will finish when one player reaches 2 points.
